Defining the Project Scope
How It Contributes to Successful Planning:
Clearly defining the project scope helps set expectations, manage resources, and stay focused on the objectives, preventing scope creep and ensuring that the project meets stakeholder needs.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into smaller, manageable components. It’s useful because it helps with task assignment, scheduling, and resource allocation.

Benefits of Developing a Detailed Project Schedule
Benefits:

Ensures that tasks are completed in a logical order.
Helps to allocate resources efficiently.
Provides a clear timeline for stakeholders.
Enables progress tracking and adjustment as needed.
How Gantt Charts Assist:
Gantt charts visually represent the project schedule, showing task dependencies, start and end dates, and milestones, which helps ensure that all tasks are completed on time.
