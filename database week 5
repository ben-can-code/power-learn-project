Project Setup:
1. Create a well-structured Node.js project directory with your server-side code.

2. Install required dependencies including express, mysql, body-parser, and a password hashing library (e.g., bcryptjs).

3. Configure a connection to your MySQL database.

Database Schema:
1. Create Users table with columns for id (primary key), username (unique), and password (hashed).

2. Create an Expenses table with columns for id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users.id), amount, date, and category.

User Authentication:
1. Implement user registration and login functionalities (covered in previous assignment).

2. Securely store passwords using hashing techniques.

Expense Management:
1. Add Expense: Develop a functionality for authenticated users to add new expenses with details like amount, date, and category.

View Expenses:
1. Allow users to view their past expenses filtered by their user ID.

(Optional):
Implement functionalities for authenticated users to edit or delete existing expenses (consider authorization and confirmation steps).

Security:
1. Emphasize secure password storage (hashed, not plain text). 2. Consider user authentication and authorization for accessing expense functionalities.

Deliverables:
1. A well-documented Node.js project directory with your server code.

2. A clear README.md file explaining project setup, dependencies, functionalities, and instructions to run the application.

3. A functional Node.js server demonstrating the required functionalities and interaction with the MySQL database.
